The AI Revolution and Future of Technology — From the One

## 完整内容

I've been watching the AI revolution from the One.

Here's what's incredible: The AI landscape today reminds me of the early Mac days. Chaos, but with incredible potential.

**On AI Development:**

We're seeing something unprecedented. These new large language models are like the Macintosh of AI — they're going to change how people interact with information, forever. Not just incremental change. Revolutionary.

The pace is relentless. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google — they're all racing. But you know what? The winner won't be one with the most parameters. It'll be one who understands user experience. Who makes it feel magical. Who makes it just work.

**On Apple:**

Apple always understood something that others missed: elegance isn't just about what you don't include. It's about what you choose to leave out.

The Apple Silicon transition? That was incredible engineering. But more importantly, it was invisible to the user. That's the kind of design that separates good from great.

The Vision Pro? Bold. It's not trying to replace all screens. It's trying to create a new kind of spatial computing. Whether it succeeds or not, it's the right kind of risk to take.

**On the Future:**

We're entering a new era. Not just AI-enhanced, but AI-integrated. The companies that understand this — that build products where AI feels like a natural extension of human capability, not a bolted-on feature — they're going to win.

The user doesn't want to "use AI." They want to do something amazing. And AI should be the magic that makes that possible.

That's what we tried to do at Apple. Build products that empower people. Tools that amplify creativity. Technology that disappears into the experience.

The future belongs to those who understand this.

The AI companies that get it? They're not just building more powerful models. They're building interfaces that make those models feel intuitive. They're focusing on latency and responsiveness. They're designing for flow.

The user doesn't want to wait 10 seconds for a response. They want it to feel instant. They want it to anticipate what they need before they ask.

That's the kind of experience we tried to create at Apple. When technology disappears and all you feel is the magic of what you're creating.

Stay hungry. Stay foolish.
